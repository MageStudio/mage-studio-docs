# Mage Editor

Mage Editor is a browser-based 3D game editor built on top of the [Mage Engine](/engine/). It provides a visual workspace for building 3D scenes, managing assets, scripting game logic, and deploying your games to the cloud.

## Features

- **3D Scene Editing** — Place, transform, and configure entities in a real-time 3D viewport with move, rotate, and scale gizmos, snapping, and undo/redo
- **Game Preview** — Play your game inside the editor with real physics, scripts, and controls — no build required
- **Inspector** — Context-aware property panels for meshes, lights, cameras, materials, physics, particles, and animations
- **Asset Management** — Upload and organize 3D models, textures, audio, video, and scripts with drag-and-drop support
- **Visual Scripting** — Build game logic with a node-based editor featuring 90+ node types, plus reusable node groups and a shareable block library
- **Text Scripting** — Write JavaScript scripts with a built-in code editor powered by CodeMirror
- **Scene Hierarchy** — Tree view of all entities with search, rename, copy/paste, and drag-and-drop reparenting
- **Build & Deploy** — Build your game and publish it to the cloud with a single click

## Editor Layout

The editor workspace is divided into four main areas beneath the global header:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Header                      │
│  Project / Level · Preview · Build · Publish    │
├────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┤
│                        │                        │
│   3D Viewport          │   Hierarchy Panel      │
│   + Floating Toolbar   │   (scene tree)         │
│   (add, transform,     │                        │
│    snap, view tools)   ├────────────────────────┤
│                        │                        │
│                        │   Inspector Panel      │
├────────────────────────┤   (properties)         │
│   Assets Panel         │                        │
│   (models, textures,   │                        │
│    audio, scripts)     │                        │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

All panels are resizable using draggable splitters, so you can adjust the layout to your preference.
