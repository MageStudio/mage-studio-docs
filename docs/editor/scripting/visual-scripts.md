# Visual Scripts

Visual scripts let you build game logic using a node-based editor — no code required. You connect nodes together to define behaviors, reactions to events, and game flow. Behind the scenes, visual scripts are compiled to JavaScript.

## The Visual Editor

The visual editor is built on React Flow and provides a canvas where you create and connect nodes:

- **Drag nodes** from the node palette onto the canvas
- **Connect nodes** by dragging from an output port to an input port
- **Pan and zoom** the canvas to navigate large graphs (the zoom range accommodates very large graphs)
- **Minimap** in the corner provides an overview of the entire graph
- **Color-coded edges** help trace data flow between nodes
- **Alignment guides** — while dragging a node, blue helper lines appear when its edges align with another node, and the node snaps into alignment
- **Auto-save** — changes are saved automatically a couple of seconds after you stop editing, with a brief "Saved" indicator

## Creating a Visual Script

1. Open the **Scripts** tab in the assets panel
2. Click the **create** button and choose to create a visual script
3. Provide a name for the script
4. The visual editor opens with an empty canvas

## Script Scope

Visual scripts have two scope options:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Entity** | Attached to a specific entity. The `start(entity)` method runs when the entity loads. Use for entity-specific behaviors like movement, reactions, and animations |
| **Level** | Attached to the level itself. The `onCreate()` method runs when the level loads. Use for global game logic, initialization, and level-wide event handling |

## Node Palette

The node palette is a searchable, categorized list of all available nodes. Drag any node from the palette onto the canvas to add it to your graph. The palette is filtered by script scope — level scripts see level lifecycle events (On Create / On Start / On Update), entity scripts see entity lifecycle events (On Start / On Update).

### Event Nodes

Event nodes trigger the connected logic when a specific event occurs:

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Keyboard Listener** | Fires on key press/release |
| **Is Key Pressed** | Query whether a key is currently held |
| **Mouse Click / Down / Up / Move** | Fires on mouse interaction |
| **Get Mouse Position** | Read the current mouse position |
| **Element Click** | Fires when a specific entity is clicked |
| **Gamepad Button / Axis / Connected** | Fires on gamepad input |
| **Touch Start / End / Move** | Fires on touch screen input |

### Entity Nodes

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Entity** | Reference to a specific entity (use entity picker to select) |
| **Self** | Reference to the entity this script is attached to |
| **Get Position / Rotation / Scale** | Read the entity's current transform |
| **Get Name** | Get the entity's name |
| **Find Entity By Name** | Look an entity up at runtime |
| **Clone Entity** | Create a copy of an entity |
| **Destroy Entity** | Remove an entity from the scene |
| **Set Data / Get Data** | Store and read arbitrary values on an entity |

### Transform Nodes

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Set Position / Rotation / Scale** | Set absolute transform values |
| **Translate** | Move relative to current position |
| **Look At** | Orient entity to face a target |
| **Get / Set Position By Key** | Read or write one component (`x`, `y`, `z`) of position, chosen by a string key |
| **Get / Set Rotation By Key** | Read or write one component of rotation by key |
| **Get / Set Scale By Key** | Read or write one component of scale by key |
| **Get / Set Quaternion By Key** | Read or write one component of the quaternion by key |

::: tip By-key nodes
The **By Key** nodes take the axis as a `key` input (a string like `"y"`) instead of a fixed node per axis — handy when the axis is computed or comes from a variable. Passing an invalid key raises a clear runtime error.

## Action Nodes

Action nodes are special container nodes. You can drag other nodes inside them to group related logic. This helps organize complex graphs into clear, logical blocks.

## Node Groups

Groups bundle several nodes into a single labelled container you can collapse, reuse, and reason about as a unit.

### Creating a group

Select two or more nodes, then press `Ctrl/Cmd+G` — or right-click and choose **Group N nodes**. The nodes are wrapped in a labelled container.

### Collapsing and expanding

**Double-click** a group to collapse it to a compact node (or expand it again) — collapsed groups expose one handle per boundary port and hide their internals. You can also use **Collapse** / **Expand** from the right-click menu.

### Group ports

Right-click a node inside a group to **Expose input** or **Expose output** for one of its handles — this promotes that handle to a named port on the group's edge, so you can wire the group from outside without expanding it. Exposed ports persist even when nothing is connected; choose **Unexpose** to remove one.

### Ungrouping

Press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+G`, or right-click and choose **Ungroup**, to dissolve a group back into its individual nodes.

### Right-click menu

The canvas context menu adapts to what's under the cursor and offers, as applicable: **Group N nodes**, **Collapse** / **Expand**, **Ungroup**, **Add to library**, and per-handle **Expose / Unexpose** options.

## Block Library

A **block** is a saved, reusable snapshot of a group — its nodes, internal wiring, and ports — that you can drop into any script. Unlike a group (which lives in one script), a block persists in a library and can be reused freely; each dropped instance is an independent copy.

### Saving a block

Right-click a group and choose **Add to library** to open the **Save block to library** dialog:

- **Block name** — a descriptive name (the group is renamed to match)
- **Available in all projects** — when on (the default), the block is saved to your account and appears in every project; when off, it's saved to the current project only

### Using blocks

The node palette has a **Library** section at the bottom, split into:

- **This project** — blocks scoped to the current project
- **My library** — your account-wide blocks

Each entry shows the block's name and port count. Drag a block onto the canvas to add an independent copy, or use its delete button to remove it from the library.

## Variable Reference Node

The **Variable Reference** node lets you reuse a variable's value anywhere in the graph without dragging a long wire across the canvas — pick a named variable and its outputs are mirrored at the reference. See the [Variable Nodes](#variable-nodes) list.

## Entity Picker

When working with **Entity** nodes, you can click "Pick from Scene" to enter entity picker mode. The 3D viewport then lets you click on any entity to select it as the reference for that node — no need to type entity names manually.

## Compiling

Visual scripts are compiled to JavaScript before they can be used in a build. The compilation:

1. Performs a topological sort of the graph
2. Generates JavaScript code for each node
3. Assembles everything into a class that extends `BaseScript` (entity scope) or `Level` (level scope)

You can preview the compiled code at any time by opening the **compiled code preview** modal. Any compilation errors are displayed here as well.

## Code Preview

The editor includes a **read-only code view** that shows the compiled JavaScript output of your visual script. This is useful for understanding what the graph produces and for debugging.

::: tip
You can switch between the visual editor and the compiled code view using the mode toggle at the top of the editor.
